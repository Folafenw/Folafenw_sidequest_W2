## Project Title

Sidequest Week 2: Platforms Emotial Blob

---

## Description

The deisgn is inspired by the emotion of panic. This project allows users to control a blob moving it from platform to platform. The blob is drawn using noise and a circle. The user will see that the blobs movements are jerky and sporadic as well as teh bright colours used to give off a sense of panic.

GBDA302 Week 2 Example 3: Platforms (AABB Collisions)

## Authors

## Fiffy Olafenwa, Folafenw, 21060319

## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces

## Assets

N/A

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.
